// Read-only telemetry aggregation for the dashboard.
//
// Everything here returns counts/aggregates only, never raw event rows. Metrics
// are organized into tiers (headline / secondary / diagnostic) and tagged with
// importance so the dashboard can present "the one number" prominently while
// still surfacing all available information.
//
// Accuracy rules (mirrors README "Accuracy notes"):
//   - Users are distinct telemetry_id, never event counts.
//   - "meaningful" = real work; see MEANINGFUL_SQL.
//   - Headline numbers exclude CI traffic (is_ci = 1) and non-release channels.
//   - Raw / less-filtered tiers are always reported alongside, never removed.

// Meaningful-activity predicate, shared by every query so all windows agree.
// A row is meaningful if it is a session_end/session_crash that did real work,
// OR a turn_end (which only fires after a completed user turn) that did work.
